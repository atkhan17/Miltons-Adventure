An aged Oliver approaches a tombstone. He stops a meter or so away,
letting the cool night breeze pass him by. The moonlight dances with the clouds,
coming and going every so often.
“It’s the same. Just as it was, so many years ago. Remember that night, Fred? 
When all was lost.
Or maybe it’d been lost long before. Who can really say?
Sometimes I ask myself, if maybe there were other courses of action I could’ve taken,
other paths of reality I could’ve walked down. Maybe there were. Maybe there are.
Maybe there’s another me, walking down those paths. Maybe in some distant reality,
it’s my name on that tombstone and you’re the one talking to my grave.”
Oliver pauses, watching as the moonlight lands on Fred’s tombstone.
“Rest in peace Oliver,” says Oliver.
