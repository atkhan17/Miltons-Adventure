Oliver walks into a washroom at school.
He sees a group of kids huddled together and notices smoke rising from where they are.
They look to be younger than himself. He notices a familiar face and walks towards him.
“You’re Fred’s younger brother right? Charlie was it?”
“Yea what about it. You was his best friend, Olive or somethin’ right?” Charlie replies.
“Was? I still am, just y’know, they only been letting family see him recently.”
“Yea nah, he’s dead.”
“What? But wasn’t he getting better?” Oliver can feel the tears gathering in his eyes.
“He didn’t want you to know how things really were ‘cause he thought maybe you was gonna do something stupid.”
Oliver feels a lump growing in his throat. He takes a deep breath as he takes the information in.
“Fuck it, let me take a hit.”
