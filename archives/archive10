As Oliver’s consciousness is drifting amidst Bernardo’s cries, the meowing stops suddenly.
He then hears a gunshot followed by the sound of his cat scurrying to his room and under his bed.
Oliver, fully awake now, grabs the table lamp beside his bed and ever quietly goes behind the door.
Some seconds later, a figure walks in and receives a warm welcome by means of a table lamp to the face.
As the figure staggers back, Oliver quickly takes the gun from their hand and chucks it across the room.
He then follows up with a sucker punch to the face.
Oliver takes a moment to turn the lights on so that he may discern said face. “Oh Charlie.”
Charlie, being semi-conscious, fails to reply. Oliver turns around to look for the gun he threw earlier.
Something about his bed catches his eye. There’s a puddle of blood under it.
He takes a deep breath and walks around the bed to the far wall.
Oliver stands over Charlie, gun in hand. He sees Charlie about to say something and quickly cuts him off,
“Save it.” He sighs and places the gun on a dresser to his left. He goes to get his phone and dials 911.
