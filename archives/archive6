Oliver walks down a long hallway, carrying a plastic bag filled with some chocolate bars.
He stops at a door to his left, slides it open and walks through. “You been skipping a bit too much class bro.”
Oliver says, sarcastically, tossing the bag in Fred’s lap.
“With what the doc been saying, I may not have to worry about school ever again.
Or anything else for that matter.” As he says it, Fred breaks a smile but it doesn’t reach his eyes.
“What’re you talking about? You’re getting out in a few months, no?”
“Hah, in a manner of speaking, yea.” Fred lets out a sigh before he continues,
“welp, that’s what happens when you're broke. Your life’s worth shit.”
“What if you weren’t broke?”
