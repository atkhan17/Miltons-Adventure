“Ollie, you gonna finish that poutine?” Fred asks.
“Huh what? Oh. no but I’m getting a takeout box so hands off,” Oliver replies, distractedly.

Some hours later, the two friends are at Oliver’s house. Fred begrudgingly watches as Oliver finishes his poutine.
He tries to distract himself by looking out the window. “I’m bored,” Fred says, dejectedly.
“Bored? Or are you just hungry?” Oliver replies as he stuffs his face with another mouthful of poutine.
“Shut up. Say, cats have pretty weird names huh?”
“Where’d that come from?”
“From my magnificent mind.”
“The same magnificent mind that failed the history test yea?” Oliver lets out a chuckle as he says it.
Fred sharply turns his gaze on Oliver at this remark. If looks could kill Oliver would be dead.
Fred lets the silence fill the room for some moments before speaking again,
“What would you name your cat if you had one?”
“I’ve got a good one, and it’s not weird. I’d name it Bernardo,”
“The fuck kinda name is Bernardo? Was he born in the 1600s or something?”
“Funny how you’re talking about the 1600s when you can’t even pass a history test.”
